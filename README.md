There are three important parts of the code.
We are only interested in population transfer rate so redfield tensor is given by R_iijj which has been plucked in the redfield equation.
First part is claclulating Rate in diabatic basis.
Second part is calculating Rate in exciton basis.
Lastly using this rate doing the time evolution of population of sites using redfield eqation.
